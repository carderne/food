## Ingredients

* Couscous (naturally)
* Butternut (pre-sliced helps)
* Pine nuts (or cheaper alternative)
* Onion
* Garlic
* Baby tomatoes
* Feta
* Rocket/other greens
* Other suitable veg!

## Method

* Fry up the garlic, onion, butternut, nuts and any other veg. Chop the butternut reasonably small so it cooks. A lid on the pan at low heat can help.
* Cook the couscous with the chopped baby tomatoes. Lots of olive oil.
* Throw it all together with feta and greents.
* Drizzle some more olive oil for good measure.
