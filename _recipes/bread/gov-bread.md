title: Government bread
source: https://anoregoncottage.com/whole-wheat-sandwich-bread-101/
yield: 1 medium-sized loaf
time: 1 day
ingredients:
- 3 to 3½ cups whole wheat flour
- 1.25 cups warm water around 40 degrees
- 0.75 Tbsp active dry yeast
- 1/6 cup honey
- 1/6 cup oil
- 1½ tsp salt
method:
- Combine water, yeast and 1 cups of the flour in a mixing bowl. Set aside to sponge for 15-20 minutes, until risen and bubbly (warmer weather takes 15 min, cooler temps usually needs 20).
- Add honey, oil, salt, and 2 cups of flour. Mix until dough starts to clean the sides of the bowl. Change to dough hook (or turn out to knead by hand), and knead 6 to 7 minutes (10 by hand). Add only a few tablespoons of flour at a time if dough sticks to sides, being careful not to add too much.
- Form into a loaf and place in a greased 9x5" pan. Allow to rise in a warm place for about 60 minutes, until 1/2 to 1-inch above pans (you may need 15-30 minutes longer if your kitchen is cold, but don't over rise or the loaf will fall when baked). Preheat the oven to 180 degrees ten minutes before rising time is done.
- Bake for 30 minutes, rotating halfway through if needed.
- Immediately remove from pans to cool on a rack. Allow to completely cool before slicing.
notes: Yum!
