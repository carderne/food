## Ingredients

* 3 Tbsp warm milk
* 2/3 cup ricotta cheese
* 4 tsp butter, softened
* 1 egg
* 2 tbsp sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1-1 1/2 cups bread flour
* 1 tsp active dry yeast

## Method

1. Mix yeast with warm milk in a large bowl and let sit for 10 minutes, until foamy and fragrant. Add ricotta, butter, egg, sugar, and salt and stir to combine. 
2. Add flour to the mixture 1/2 cup at a time until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Knead lightly for a few minutes, making sure not to allow the dough to become sticky -- add more flour if necessary. 
3. Place in a clean, lightly floured bowl, cover with a towel, and let rise in a warm place for 30-45 minutes. Don't over-proof on this batch proof. 
4. Punch down any rise and separate the dough into six equally sized balls. Place each ball in a greased muffin tin. Proof for another 1-1 1/2 hours. 
5. Bake at 180C for 15 minutes, until risen well above the tin like a muffin and golden brown on top. Enjoy warm with butter! 

## Modifications
