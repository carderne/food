#### Ingredients

* 1 sweet potato, cubed
* 1/2 red onion, chopped finely
* 1/2 tin of black beans, drained and rinse
* 1/3 cup sweet corn
* 1/2 tin refried beans
* cotija or cheddar cheese (shredded)
* 6 tortillas (I like the corn/wheat mix. If you have to choose between wheet and corn, corn has a nicer flavor, but flour is easier to work with.)
* spices: tajin, paprika, cumin, cayenne pepper, chipotle flakes, salt, pepper, etc.
* olive oil
* enchilada sauce of choice (salsa works in a pinch, homemade as found here: https://damndelicious.net/2014/03/17/homemade-enchilada-sauce/, green, or mole)
* garnish: sour cream, avocado, cilantro, lime

Method

1. Prepare the ingredients: boil sweet potato until soft and easily mashable. Chop onion and shred cheese. Preheat the oven to 180 C.
2. Mix together the soft sweet potato, red onion, black beans, corn, and a sprinkling of cheese. Add spices, a tsp of olive oil, and a little bit of the enchilada sauce. Mix together until everything is well incorporated and you have a lump sweet potato paste!
3. In the bottom of a baking dish, add a thin layer of enchilada sauce. 
4. For each tortilla, smear with a layer of refried beans, then add a generous line of the sweet potato filling to the center of the tortilla. Lift and tuck one side of the tortilla over the line, and then roll to close.
5. Lay each enchilada with the fold side down in the baking dish. 6 should fit snugly in a standard size baking dish. 
6. Cover with more enchilada sauce, using a spatula to make sure it's even across the tortillas. It's a matter of personal taste how much sauce to use, but there should at least be enough to cover the cracks between the enchiladas. Top with a layer of cheese.
7. Bake for 20 minutes, until the cheese is totally melted and bubbling.
