## Ingredients
- anchovies
- pasta (slower cook preferably, so you get starchier water)
- tomato sauce/paste
- garlic
- parmesan
- olives if you like

## Method
- Get the pasta water boiling with some salt.
- Gently fry the garlic, add tomato sauce/paste and simmer.
- Chop up the anchovies and add to the simmering sauce.
- Cook the pasta.
- Once it's nearly al dente, ladel it into the sauce, making sure lots of starchy water comes with.
- Mix it up, grate on some parmesan, throw some sliced olives in, and serve.
