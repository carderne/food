## Ingredients

* 200 - 300 g sweet potato or butternut (or both!), cubed 
* 2 red onions, roughly chopped
* 2 cloves of garlic, minced
* 1/2 red chili, or less depending on heat tolerance, finely minced
* 1 red pepper, chopped into small pieces
* 1 tin of kidney beans, reserve liquid
* 1 tsp ground coriander
* 1 tsp smoked paprika
* Â½ a bunch of fresh coriander , (15g)
* 4 ripe tomatoes
* 275 ml vegetable stock (more may be needed for slow cooker)



## Method

1. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil into a large pan over a medium-high heat, add the sweet potato/butternut, onions, and red pepper, cooking for 8 minutes, or until softened but charred and gnarly on the outside.
2. Drain the beans, but reserve the juice. Add the beans to the hot pan and cook for 1 more minute.
3. Stir through, then add the garlic, chili, ground coriander, and paprika. Season well with salt and pepper and cook for 3 minutes, or until sticky and gnarly.
4. Finely slice the coriander (stalks and all). Roughly chop the tomatoes. Add to the pan with their juices, along with the coriander stalks, the reserved liquid from the beans and 275ml of vegetable stock.
5. Bring to the boil, then simmer for a minimum of 15 minutes, until the veg is soft and the sauce has thickened. Would be great cooked for long at a low temperature to develop all the rich, smoky flavors. Add an extra splash of vegetable stock or water to loosen if the sauce gets too thick.
6. Serve with the rice, a dollop of creme fraiche and the reserved coriander scattered on top.
