## Ingredients

* 2 large eggs
* 1 large egg yolk
* 1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
* 1/3 cup white sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 2 teaspoons cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
* 1/8 teaspoon cardamom
* 1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
* 2 cups homemade pumpkin purée or 1 (15-ounce can) pumpkin purée
* 1 1/2 cups heavy cream or 1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk
* 1 homemade pie crust, or 2 frozen premade pie shells

## Method

1. Prepare the crust(s): If using a homemade crust, line a deep-dish pie pan and freeze for at least 30 minutes (1 or 2 hours is even better). If using store-bought frozen crusts, simply unwrap them just before using. You’ll need 2.
   Preheat the oven:
2. Preheat your oven to 425°F. Position a rack in the bottom 1/3 of the oven.
   Make the filling: Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Mix in the brown sugar, white sugar, salt, cinnamon, ground ginger, nutmeg, ground cloves, cardamom, and lemon zest.
3. Mix in the pumpkin purée. Stir in the cream. Beat together until everything is well mixed. The mixture will be runny but will set up in the oven. 
4. Fill the pie shell and bake: Pour the filling into 1 chilled homemade deep-dish pie crust or 2 premade frozen pie shells. Bake in the oven at a high temperature of 425°F for 15 minutes.
5. After 15 minutes, lower the temperature to 350°F. The pie is done when a knife tip inserted in the center comes out wet but relatively clean. The center should be just barely jiggly. For 1 deep-dish pie, this will take 50 to 60 minutes more. For 2 shallow pies, bake for 35 to 45 minutes more. Note that the pumpkin pie will come out of the oven all puffed up (from the leavening of the eggs), and will deflate as it cools.
6. Cool the pie on a rack, then serve: Cool the pumpkin pie on a wire rack for 2 hours. Serve with [](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/how_to_make_whipped_cream/)whipped cream.

Note: You can leave cooled pumpkin pie on the counter for up to 4 hours, then wrap it tightly and move it to the fridge for up to 3 days. If possible, let it come to room temperature before serving. For longer storage, tightly wrap individual slices or a whole, cooled pie and freeze for up to 1 month. Defrost overnight in the fridge and let come to room temperature before serving.
