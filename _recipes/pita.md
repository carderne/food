## Ingredients
- ~3 cups bread flour (substitute some whole wheat if you like)
- 1 cup water
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 4g dry yeast
- 1 Tbsp sugar
- 2 tsp salt

## Method
### Dough
- Mix the water (warmed if your kitchen is cold), yeast and sugar.
- Add half the flour and stir until relatively homogeneous.
- Add the salt and olive oil.
- Add more flour, stirring as you go. You want a nice dense dough that you can easily knead; we're making pita bread here, not artisanal sourdough.
- Knead about 5 minutes until it feels smooth and strong.
- Leave to rise in an oiled bowl until doubled.
- Divide into 8 portions, roll each into a ball, and leave to rise again until doubled.

### Cooking
- Cast iron pan is best. Heat it with olive oil.
- With a floured surface, prepare the balls into flat circles one-by-one, dropping them onto the pan as soon as they're ready.
- Cook for about a minute on each side, getting nicely browned and blackened burn marks.
- Re-oil as necessary!
