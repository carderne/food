## Ingredients

* Medium egg noodles (2 nests -- can use more for more servings, but adjust the sauce accordingly)
* Zucchini 
* Aubergine
* Breaded chicken breast cutlets
* Some pickled veg (we had a lovely pickled cabbage and red pepper mix from M&S)
* Scallions and/or cilantro (for garnish)
* Sesame seeds
* Teriyaki sauce (optional)

For the sauce:

* Miso paste (not more than 1 tbsp for 2 servings)
* Soy sauce
* Sesame oil (just a drop)
* Vegetable oil
* Maple syrup or honey
* Apple cider or rice wine vinegar (just a drop)
* Grated or minced ginger and garlic
* Red chili flakes or sriracha (optional)
* Black pepper
* A splash of water to loosen everything up

## Method

1. Cube the aubergine and zucchini into very small pieces and fry in lots of oil until very soft and golden. I did this separately, as the aubergine needed to cook for much longer. 
2. Once cooked, they can be removed to a bowl until ~5-10 mins before the chicken is ready.
3. Cook or heat the breaded chicken. Boil water for the egg noodles.
4. With ~5-10 mins left before the chicken is ready, add the sauce mix to a medium-hot pan and add the cooked vegetables back in. Simmer gently. 
5. When the chicken is out of the oven and resting, add the egg noodles to boiling water according to their instructions. Drain completely, and mix with the sauce and vegetables in a wok or large bowl. 
6. Cut the chicken into strips.
7. Dish the noodles and vegetables into their bowls, top with strips of chicken, pickled vegetables, and scallions or cilantro for a colorful garnish. Drizzle teriyaki sauce over the chicken to finish. Enjoy!
