## Ingredients
- 2 1/2 cups milk
- 1 1/2 cups butter (melted)
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons freshly ground cardamom (from about 25 cardamom pods)
- 2 packages dry active yeast (4 1/2 teaspoons)
- 8 to 9 cups all-purpose flour (or bread flour)
- 1/3 cup butter (melted)
- 2/3 cup granulated sugar
- 2 tablespoons cinnamon
- 1 egg plus 2 tablespoons water (lightly beaten together into an egg wash)
- "Garnish: pearl sugar and/or toasted sliced almonds"

## Method
- Heat milk to a light boil, turning off heat when it reaches the scalding point (when small bubbles appear across the top).
- Stir in melted butter, sugar, salt, and ground cardamom. Let mixture cool until “finger-warm” (still quite warm, but just cool enough to touch).
- Stir in yeast and let sit for 10 minutes.
- Add flour to mixture 1/2 cup at a time until dough is firm and pulls away from the sides of your mixing bowl. (If using a stand mixer, exchange the mixing paddle for the dough hook after you’ve added the first 5 cups of flour. Use the dough hook to mix and knead the dough as you add the remaining 3 to 4 cups of flour.)
- Cover the dough in the mixing bowl with a clean towel and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
- Punch down the dough following this first rise, remove from the bowl, and knead lightly on a floured surface until smooth and shiny. Divide dough into two halves.
- Roll each half of dough into a 12 by 18-inch rectangle. Brush each rectangle well using the 1/3 cup melted butter.
- Combine sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl; sprinkle evenly over the 2 rectangles. Starting at one of the long sides, roll each rectangle like a jelly roll to form an 18-inch-long cylinder.
- Using a sharp or serrated knife, cut each cylinder into 20 equal slices.
- Place each slice in a paper cupcake wrapper and place wrappers on a baking sheet. Cover with a towel and allow to double in size, about 45 minutes.
- Preheat oven to 425 F.
- Brush risen cinnamon rolls with egg wash and sprinkle with pearl sugar and/or almonds.
- Place in the middle of the oven and bake for 7 minutes, or until golden and firm.
