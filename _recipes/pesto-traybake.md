#### Ingredients

* 500g baby potatoes, halved (quartered if large)
* butternut squash or sweet potato, cubed
* 2 red onions, cut into thin wedges
* 3 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling
* 100g green pesto
* 1 courgette, cut into chunks
* 3 salad tomatoes, cut into wedges
* 1 ciabatta roll
* half a block of feta



#### Method

1. Preheat the oven to 200’C. 
2. Put the potatoes, squash and red onions onto a large shallow roasting tray and drizzle with 2 tbsp oil. Season and toss to combine. Roast for 20 mins. 
3. In a small bowl, mix 2 tbsp of the pesto with 1 tbsp oil to make a dressing. Set aside for later. Whisk the remaining pesto with 3 tbsp water to loosen.
4. After 20 mins, add the courgette and tomatoes to the tray and roast for another 10 mins until the veg is tender.
5. Pour the loosened pesto over the veg and toss everything together. Tear the ciabatta roll into chunky croutons and scatter over the veg. Crumble over the salad cheese and drizzle everything with oil. Roast for another 5-10 mins until the croutons are toasted and the cheese is turning golden. Drizzle over the pesto dressing to serve.
