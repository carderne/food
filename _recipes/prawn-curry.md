## Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon vegetable or coconut oil
- 1 large red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and cut into thin strips
- 1 tablespoon peeled and minced fresh ginger (from a 1-inch piece)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 tablespoons Thai red curry paste
- 1 pound peeled and deveined uncooked medium shrimp
- 2 heads baby bok choy (about 1 pound total), root end trimmed and leaves cut into 2-inch pieces
- 1 (13- to 14-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk
- 1/2 cup water
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- Juice from 1 medium lime (about 2 tablespoons)
- 1/2 cup coarsely chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems

## Method
- Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add the bell pepper, ginger, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 1 minute.
- Stir in the curry paste and saut√© for 1 minute. Add the coconut milk, water, salt, and pepper and stir to combine.
- Bring the mixture to a simmer, stir in the shrimp and bok choy, and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until the shrimp are pink and opaque, the bell pepper is just tender, and the bok choy is wilted, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the lime juice and cilantro. Serve immediately over rice, if desired.
