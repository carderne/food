## Ingredients
### Initial feed
- 1/2 cup lukewarm water
- 1 cup wholewheat flour

### Subsequent feeds
- 1/2 cup starter (stirred down)
- 1/2 cup lukewarm water
- 1 cup white flour

## Method
### Schedule
- Day 1: 8:30 am: Do *initial feed*, cover with a cloth and leave for 24 hours.
- Day 2: 8:30 am: Do *next feed* as described above.
- Day 3: 8:30 am: Should have solid bubbling/foaming and some smell by now. Feed and then feed again at 8:30 pm.
- Day 4: Feed at 8:30 am and 8:30 pm.
- Repeat for up to a week until you reach the goal: it should at least double within 1-4 hours of feeding. If you think it's reached this stage, instead of discarding when you feed it, use that discard to make some bread and see if it works well. If it does, you're ready for the next step.
- Now move to the fridge, make sure covered but not airtight. From here you can feed once a week, I'll share tips later.
- All in all this used about 700g of flour or so...

### My log
- (Sat 4) Started 15:00 .5 cup wholewheat, 1 cup water. Kept in warm office, oven overnight (quite hot initially!). Quite dry.
- (Sun 5) Fed ~16:00 .5 cup all-purpose, 1 cup water. Low activity, some hooch (poured out). Kept in office in day, microwave with hot water bottle otherwise.
- (Mon 6) Fed ~20:30 same. Lots of activity, bubbly and fruity.
- (Tue 7) Fed 8:30. Shot up to top of the jar then down again. Fed again 20:30.
- (Wed 8) Fed 8:30. Same up down as before. Used discard for pizza (fed, waited 4 hours, then added flour, then doubled again in about 4 hours, pizza good). Fed again 20:30. Seems same each day now.
- (Thu 9) Fed 8:30. Moved to fridge 12:30. Continued growing slowly. Will feed once a week now.
- (Fri 10) Has settled back down but looking happy.
