## Ingredients

* 4 cups masa harina, or more to taste
* 2 cups water, or as needed
* Â½ cup vegetable oil for frying
* Cheese and refried beans, for the filling

## Method

1. Mix masa harina and 1/2 cup water together in a bowl by hand. Add the remaining water slowly, about 2 tablespoons at a time, mixing well after each addition, until dough is moist but still firm. Cover with a wet towel.
2. Heat 1/2 cup oil a large skillet over medium-high heat.
3. Take a golf ball-sized piece of dough and roll into a ball in your hands. Make a hole in the dough ball with your thumb; put a small amount of cheese/beans inside the hole, close it up, and flatten the ball with your hands into a thick tortilla shape. Place pupusa in the skillet and fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.
4. Serve with vinegary coleslaw, sour cream, and veggies.
