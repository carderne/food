#### Ingredients

* 200g / half a packet of biscuits (we used digestives)
* 75g butter
* 350g cream cheese
* 350g mascarpone cheese
* 200g icing sugar, sifted
* 1/2 vanilla bean pod (split pod in half lengthways, then scrape beans from one side) or 1 tsp vanilla extract

#### Method

1. Put the digestive biscuits into a bag and crush them with a rolling pin.
2. Melt the butter in a large saucepan. Remove from heat and tip the biscuit crumbs into the butter. Mix until thoroughly combined. Press the buttery crumbs into the bottom of a 23cm/9in springform or loose-bottomed tin. Chill in the refrigerator while you make the topping.
3. Combine the cream cheese and mascarpone in a large mixing bowl. Using an electric handheld mixer, blend together until light and fluffy (around 2 mins).
4. Add the icing sugar a little at a time and blend to incorporate. Finally, gently fold in the vanilla. The mixture should be very light and fluffy. 
5. Spread the cream cheese mixture over the biscuit base and smooth the top with a palette knife or spatula. Cover with cling film and chill in the fridge for at least four hours.

Could add a layer of lemon curd or berry coulis before the cheese, or top with either. Could also mix in flavorings or candy, but it's sweet enough as-is! The real vanilla beans give it a lovely, light, custardy flavor.
