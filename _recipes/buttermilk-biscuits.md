## Ingredients

* 190g plain flour
* 105g polenta cornmeal
* 2 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 1/4 tsp bicarbonate of soda
* 15g caster sugar
* 1 tsp fine salt
* 90g unsalted butter, diced
* 190ml buttermilk

## Method

* Set a rack in the centre of the oven and preheat oven to 230C. Line a baking sheet with two layers of parchment paper.
* Whisk together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, sugar, and salt. Rub 30g of the butter into the flour mixture with your fingertips, until it is completely incorporated. Work the remaining butter into the flour until it's in even, pea-sizes pieces. Gently stir in the buttermilk to make a loose dough.
* Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Pat the dough into a 1cm thick rectangle. Fold the dough in thirds like a business letter. Pat the dough into a 13 by 20cm rectangle about 2cm thick. Use a 5 to 8cm round cutter to make 6 biscuits, and put biscuits on the prepared baking sheet. Press together the scraps of dough, cut 2 more biscuits, and place them on the baking sheet.
* Bake until the tops are lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Cool slightly on a rack before serving.

## Modifications

* Alternative method of incorporating butter: Place pre-measured buttermilk in a glass container in the freezer for 10-15 minutes. Meanwhile, melt butter and let cool (but not harden). Pour butter into cold buttermilk and stir until the butter hardens into small chunks throughout. Add to dry mixture (no need to "cut" your butter into little pearls this way!).
* Also, this recipe can be modified to super-load the biscuits with extra goodies! During the third step, when the dough is rolled out into a rectangle and before folding, you can add extra ingredients (cheddar and chives are my favorite addition!) and simply fold them into the dough. Continue the rest of step three as normal!
