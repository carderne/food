## Ingredients

* At least 400g lamb shoulder in chunks
* 3 large carrots
* 1/2 large rutabaga (swede)
* 1 sweet onion
* 2-3 cloves garlic
* 1 tbsp tomato paste
* 2 tsp corn starch
* \*2 cups broth (veggie or beef)
* 2-3 sprigs fresh thyme
* olive oil
* \*optional, add 1 cup stout beer (if so, reduce broth by 1 cup)

## Method

* Heat olive oil in the bottom of a large pot, on medium heat. Add lamb shoulder and cook until nicely seared and caramelized. Immediately remove from heat. 
* In the remaining oil and drippings from the lamb, cook onion and garlic until fragrant and soft, but before it browns. 
* Add the tomato paste and stir until well incorporated. 
* Add broth (and optional beer), carrots, rutabaga, corn starch, and thyme. Mix to combine.
* Cover and simmer for at least one hour, stirring frequently, or until lamb and vegetables are tender and the flavor is robust. You can add more corn starch or water, depending on your desired thickness.
* Remove thyme stems and serve! Enjoy with a garnish of sour cream, and sides of rice or roasted/mashed potatoes.
