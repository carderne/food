## Ingredients

* 450g plain flour  
* 1 tsp salt 
* 1 tsp baking powder  
* 200ml whole milk 
* 100ml natural yogurt 
* 1 egg 
* 1 tbsp caster sugar 
* butter/garlic for brushing
* small bunch of coriander, chopped, to serve 

## Method

1. Mix the flour, salt and baking powder together in a bowl. 
2. In a jug, whisk together the milk, yogurt, egg and caster sugar. 
3. Make a well in the centre of the flour and pour in the milk mixture. Mix together with one hand, to a soft, sticky dough.  
4. Turn out the dough onto a lightly oiled worktop. Knead for 5 minutes, until smooth, then place the dough into a lightly oiled bowl, cover and leave to rest for 30 minutes. 
5. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured worktop and divide into 8 equal pieces. Shape 1 piece into a ball, flatten it, then roll it into a teardrop shape about 3–5mm thick, 20cm long and 12cm at its widest point. Repeat for the remaining dough pieces.  
6. Lay a heavy-based metal baking sheet on a grill pan and heat under a hot grill for 5 minutes. One at a time, lay the naan on the hot baking sheet and grill for 1–2 minutes, until the naan bubbles up. (Keep a close eye on it, as it will burn easily as it puffs.)  
7. Remove the naan from the grill, brush with butter and garlic, and set aside to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining naans, then sprinkle with chopped coriander to serve.
