## Ingredients

* chicken breast fillets
* olive oil
* 1 sweet onion
* 3 large cloves garlic
* 1 jalapeño (or use canned jalapenos; remove seeds for a more mild flavor)
* cumin, paprika, chili powder, salt, and black pepper (to taste)
* 1 tin crushed tomatoes
* 3 generous spoonfuls of salsa
* 3 cups chicken or veggie broth
* 1 can black beans
* 1 cup sweet corn

## Garnish

* cilantro
* lime
* avocado
* tortillas

## Method

* Heat olive oil over medium heat. Cook onion, garlic, and jalapeño until soft and fragrant. 
* Add spices and mix to incorporate. 
* Then add remaining ingredients: tomatoes, broth, beans, corn, salsa, and chicken breast (if the breasts are very large, it's best to cut them in half to make sure they cook through).
* Simmer for 20 minutes, stirring frequently. 
* While cooking, prepare garnish: cut the tortillas into strips, spray or brush with olive oil, and toast at 180C for around 5-10 minutes. Watch carefully to make sure they don't catch at the sides. Chop cilantro, shred cheese, and prepare avocado. 
* After 20 minutes, remove the chicken from the pot and shred using two forks, placing them in the chicken and pulling in opposite directions. You can leave the shredded chunks relatively large, per your personal taste. Return the chicken to the pot and simmer for 3-5 more minutes. 
* Serve hot, with plenty of garnishes!
