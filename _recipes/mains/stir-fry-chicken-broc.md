## Ingredients
- 2 boneless chicken breasts or thighs
- broccoli head
- mushrooms (optional!)
- 2 Tbsp soy sauce (low sodium best)
- 2 tsp corn starch
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1 clove garlic minced
- small nub ginger minced
- five spice
- 1 Tbsp rice vinegar (or equal parts mirin, lime juice, and white wine vinegar)
- 2 Tbsp brown sugar
- 2 Tbsp peanut/canola oil
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- water
- birds eye chilies, scallions, both optional
- handful of unsalted roasted peanuts or cashews, optional

## Method
- Cut chicken breast into chunky cubes and marinate for 30 minutes (minimum) in soy sauce with cornstarch, baking soda, and 1 Tbsp of water.
- Meanwhile, steam broccoli for 3 minutes until perky and bright green in a steaming basket or bamboo steamer. If using mushrooms, fry in a small amount of sesame or peanut oil until fragrant and browned. Set both broccoli and mushrooms aside.
- Whisk together rice vinegar, brown sugar, vegetable oil and sesame oil, the garlic and ginger and other spices, scallions, and whatever else you want with a bit of corn starch and set aside.
- In a large wok or deep pan, heat a drop of vegetable. Add the chicken with all of its marinade. Saut√© on medium heat for about 3 minutes, when the marinade is thick and bubbling.
- Add the sauce you have mixed on the side. Mix well and let simmer for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. For a thinner sauce, add water to reach your desired thickness.
- When the sauce looks bubbly and thick, and the garlic no longer has a raw smell to it, lower the heat, and stir in the broccoli, as well as the mushrooms and nuts if you choose. Let cook together for another 1-2 minutes, until the broccoli has soaked up some of the sauce and all of the vegetables look well coated.
- Serve with rice (we used coconut rice and it was fabulous!) or thick noodles.
