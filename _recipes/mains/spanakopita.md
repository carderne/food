## Ingredients
- filo pastry
- 1 cup butter (can probably get away with less)
- 400g frozen chopped spinach
- 200g feta
- an onion
- 2 cloves garlic
- chopped pine nuts!
- some green onion if you have it
- 2 eggs (if you want better binding)
- salt, pepper, oregano, chilli flakes etc

## Method

### Filling
- Defrost the filo pastry slowly in the fridge, and leave it cool until you need it.
- Defrost the spinach and squeeze all liquid out.
- Fry the onions, garlic, pine nuts, green onions and seasoning.
- Mix together with the spinach, feta and eggs.

### Making the pies
- Set the oven to 190 C and get a large working space ready.
- Figure out what size pies and how may layers will work. We did four pies with five layers each, with each pie ending up around 15x15cm.
- Lay out a layer, brush with butter (don't worry about the edges), and add a layer, and repeat for how many layers you're doing.
- Scoop your filling into the middle.
- Fold the layers over the top one by one, re-buttering if need be.
- Can add a final layer wrapped over the top if you like (more butter).
- Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden!
