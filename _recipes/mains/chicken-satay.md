## Ingredients

### Peanut sauce
- 3 Tbsp peanut butter
- 165 ml cononut milk

- 2 crushed garlic cloves
- 1 lime zest and juice
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp honey
- 1 Tbsp curry powder
- 1 tsp vegetable oil

### Cucumber salad
- 1 cucumber
- 2 Tbsp white wine vinegar

- fresh coriander

## Method
- Mix up the ingredients for the peanut sauce. Set aside 2/3rds for simmering and 1/3rd for marinading the chicken.
- Put the chicken between some baking sheets and give it some bashing and rolling to get it nice and flat.
- Get the chicken and the marinade together.
- Get the sauce simmering.
- Sew the chicken onto the skewers in an S-shape.
- Lightly oil a suitably sized baking tray and line up the skewers on top so the chicken isn't touching.
- Grill at high temperature for about 10 minutes, turning as needed.

### Cucumber salad
- Use a peeler to peel the cucumber and some way into the flesh.
- Dissolve sugar into vinegar and pour over the peels.
