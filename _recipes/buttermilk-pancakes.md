## Ingredients

* 350g [](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/self-raising_flour)self-raising flour
* 1 tsp [](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/bicarbonate_of_soda)bicarb
* ½ tsp salt
* 2 tbsp [](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/caster_sugar)caster sugar
* 200ml [](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/buttermilk)buttermilk
* 400ml semi-skimmed [](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/milk)milk
* 2 free-range eggs
* 85g unsalted butter
* maple syrup, to serve

## Method

1. In a bowl, sift together the flour, bicarbonate of soda, salt and sugar.
2. In a separate bowl or jug, mix together the buttermilk, milk, eggs and butter. Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and stir to combine. Do not overbeat – stir just to combine.
3. Melt a small knob of butter in a large frying pan. Using a ladle, pour some batter into the pan to make a pancake. Depending on the size of the pan, you may be able to make more than one pancake at a time, or if you are confident you can use two pans at the same time.
4. Cook the pancakes for about a minute, or until the underside is golden brown and the top is bubbling. Turn them over using a palette knife or fish slice and cook for another minute. Keep the pancakes warm in a very low oven while you cook the remaining batter.
5. Serve the pancakes stacked on top of each other, drizzled with maple syrup
