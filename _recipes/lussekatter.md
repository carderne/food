## Ingredients
- ½ tsp saffron threads
- 2 Tbsp milk
- ½ c raisins
- 1 ½ c milk, warmed to 80F
- 2¼ tsp active dry yeast
- ¾ c sugar
- 6 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 1 egg, lightly beaten
- ½ tsp salt
- 6 - 6 ½ c unbleached all purpose flour
- 1 egg
- 2 Tbsp water

## Method
- Place the saffron threads in a small bowl and carefully grind them into a fine powder using the back of a spoon (or use a mortar and pestle). Add 2 Tbsp of milk and set the mixture aside for an hour or two, stirring occasionally, to let the saffron dye the milk.
- Place the raisins in a small bowl and cover with warm water. Set them aside to plump.
- Place the warmed milk in a large mixing bowl. Mix in a few Tbsp of the sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over top of the milk and let it stand until the yeast has softened and begins to foam, 5-10 min.
- Mix in the remaining sugar, melted and cooled butter, beaten egg, and prepared saffron milk. Add the salt and flour, 1 cup at a time, mixing after each addition. Add just enough flour so that the dough comes together to a knead-able consistency.
- Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured countertop and knead for 5-6 minutes, adding more flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking to your hands. Once the dough is smooth and soft, shape it into a ball and place it into a clean, greased bowl. Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel and let the dough rise in a warm, draft free place for 60-90 min, until doubled.
- Once risen, turn the dough out on the counter and knead it a few times. Divide the dough into 24, roughly even, pieces. Roll each piece into a ball. Then, roll each ball into a 6 inch snake. Finally, roll each snake longer, to about 13-14 inches. (This dough has a tendency to spring back on you, which is why we roll it out in stages. Giving it time to relax will make it easier to get your long snake.)
- For each snake, spiral the ends in opposite directions to form a scrolled “S”. Place the scrolled “S” onto a baking sheet that has been lined with parchment paper.
- Drain your raisins and place them on a paper towel to dry. (Pat them dry if necessary. Put one raisin in the middle of each spiral. Continue with the remaining dough.
- Beat together the egg and water for your egg wash. Brush the mixture on the buns.
- Let the buns rise in a warm, draft free place for 20-30 minutes, or until the buns are puffy and have nearly doubled in size.
- Near the end of this last rising time, preheat your oven to 425F. Bake the buns for 8-10 min minutes, until golden. Remove the buns from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes before enjoying the warm rolls!
