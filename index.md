title: Welcome to Boutyrophagoi
---

Boutyrophagoi is a bit of a weird name for a website. 


It means butter-eaters.


This barely pronounceable word (don’t ask us, we’re not sure either) was used in Ancient Greece, most famously by the Greek poet Anaxandrides, as a marker for northern, butter-eating barbarians. 

I’m not sure whether we qualify as barbarians, but we couldn’t think of a more apropos name for our recipe site than “butter-eaters” – we’re sure you’ll agree, once you’ve had a closer look.

We set up this space in order to keep (and share) recipes that we love: whether we create them ourselves, find them on the internet, or they are passed down to us by people we love. 

The food we eat tells stories about who we are, where we come from, and how we like to live our lives. We’re really excited to share these pieces of ourselves, and treasured pieces of others, with you. 


This site is in beta, as are the recipes! Please have patience with us as we keep working on filling it up and making it great. And if you have something to add, let us know! 


P.S. It’s “bouty” for sure… where do you think all that butter ends up?!
